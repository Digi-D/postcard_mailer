# Postcard Mailer
Code experiments for online component of "The International" - postcard sale and distribution

Uses Stripe for credit card processing and Lob for mailing the cards. I was learning how to use both of these services, so have scripts/microsites that can be used as basic tutorials (node test_charge_card.js and node test_create_mailer.js).
